## About Me

Hello, world! I'm Edward, a Computer Science student in the University of Nottingham Ningbo and a passionate programmer. 
I'm here to help making a change, to learn more, and to make code beyond than just binaries.

## Skills that I can help you with

### Languages

- Human Languages
  - Bahasa Indonesia
  - English
  - Mandarin
  
- Computer Languages
  - HTML
  - CSS
  - Javascript
  - Python
  - Swift
  - Dart
  - Java

### As a Programmer
All programming languages aren't that different at its core, so I used my free time to develop skillsets to learn something that can contribute to the market.
Also trying my best to implement efficient space and time codes.

### As a Web Developer
I am familiar with OOP, module design pattern and state pattern in Javascript, Regular Expression, AJAX and XHR, http REST API ,terminal CLI on macOS, noSQL database like mongoDB, Node's framework Express.js, and Node.js.

### As an App Developer
Able to develop apps with MVC design pattern, design with Xcode, and code in Swift.
I'm learning flutter after I realised Apple doesn't really dominate the market in China, and enjoy using it. 
Able to use flutter providers pattern to make apps more efficient.

### As a Python Programmer
Python is really popular in the market, after DS, ML , and AI are currently used everywhere. 
So, I learned python as my primary scripting language and learned some data-sci along the way.
Have a good grasp to code in Python and command line interface. Have created a face recognition and visualisation of google search data for over 5 years. 

## Goals that I have in life

### Making code beyond binary through ideas and creativity

[Bill Gates](https://singjupost.com/bill-gates-commencement-speech-at-harvard-2007-full-transcript/) once said "But humanity’s greatest advances are not in its discoveries, but in how those discoveries are applied to reduce inequity."

Technology is here to make the world a better place. ML can make our apps more advanced through personalisation, recommendation etc, App Development serves as the platform of today's software tech, and Web development is important to create our own API. 

Web Apps, Mobile Apps, ML-DS-AI have been here for some times. These technology are tools that have been applied to our modern life to make our world a better place.

### Working in a startup, or building one

One of the many things I learned after watching Silicon Valley HBO, its that, startups change the world. Building a team, doing SCRUM for works, eating pizza and codes, start a fundraising, getting sued by your competitor, keep inventing new ideas and work to your goals, and finally change the world, okay that went really bad for a second.

It is undeniable that startup have a really high chances of failures. My chance building unicorn company is lower than getting strucked by lightning, but it doesn't change the facts that startups change the world. Technology grows really fast, and I want to be the part that contributes to the future.

### Work in one of the Big 4/ Big 5 

Mentioning each of their contributions here is not enough. Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Google, Microsoft, working with them are the dreams of every programmer. Every programmer and majority of human society. 

The only (-) I see here is probably just because I don't think I'll ever quit a job in these companies, which means I won't grow a lot because of the pace of big companies are different than startups. I would solve this by build some startups and build some experiences before having worthy value for them.

The (+) is everything else. Great environment to work, free lunch, high paying jobs, I can add it on my resume, and a lot of other things.

## Values I can give as human being

### Tutoring

[Mark Zuckeberg](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2017/05/mark-zuckerbergs-speech-as-written-for-harvards-class-of-2017/) once said 
"But it’s not just about money. You can also give time. I promise you, if you take an hour or two a week — that’s all it takes to give someone a hand, to help them reach their potential." on his Harvard speech. Link have been provided as a credibility

That speech was probably refering to the CS Harvard graduates, but yeah it doesn't really change the message.
We love to talk about making a world a better place, but better place means better people as well. If I could help someone learn something in the field of computers, I want to help them. It will take some time, but no one become good in 1 night.

I put my learning sources and some introduction to code in [here](https://edwardtanoto.github.io/educationstation/index.html)

### Problem Solving Skills

One thing I learn from programming is, you spent 10% of your time to code, and 90% to figure what is wrong with your code.
Good news is, most programmers are already used to this situation, we learn. We are used to solving problems by splitting it into small pieces, figuring out what is wrong, and then solve it carefully.

### Leadership skills

Programming is literally giving computer set of instructions to do a task. 
But computers and humans are different, the difference between humans and computers are their creativity. So, basically everything.

Leadership in general is a skill to influence people. It's a different skill than compiling whatever codes you tell your computer to do to create whatever you want.

In my opinion, leadership is a skill about building a chemistry in a team that you become love working with them, and high chemistry team is a team that loves what they are doing and doing their best to achieve their goals together.
